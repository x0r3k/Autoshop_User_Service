1. try to fix Sequelize JSON config import and compilation
1.1 .json does not move to dist/ with tsc if used "require"
1.2 .json moves to dist/ if "import" but it cant be reached by indexing [env]
1.3 .js and .ts same to 1.2
1.4 if write [key: string] interface to config, then it can be reached by [env], but Sequelize Constructor does not accept this file (wrong interface)

1 - Fixed

2. Try to create new model/migration and make associations

2 - In progress

3. Improve models.index.ts by automatic invoking of model.associate() if exists

3 - In progress

4. Create type for exported object in models/index.ts

# Cannot be converted because of npm script does not work
# The same about config.ts


6. Type parameter in model.associate(models) by type from p.4
